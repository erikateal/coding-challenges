Here you will find the solutions to my daily coding challenges. I like to keep track of my day-to-day process so that I can see the progress I'm making as I acquire additional skills.

## Optimizations

As I learn new concepts, I review my code to see if it can be further optimized for efficiency and/or readability. 

## Lessons Learned:

Below, I've included an example of what the learning process looks like for me.

The most important thing that I've learned thus far is to keep going! There were challenges that I could not solve a month ago that I can now do without giving them much thought at all. Learning can be a grueling process but I've come to the realization that if I put the time in, I can learn anything.
